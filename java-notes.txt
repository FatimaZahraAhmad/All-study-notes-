JVM(Java Virtual Machine) - a special software layer that allows java programs to run on any device oroperating system

Replit - an IDE

JDK(Java Development Kit) - a complete software package used for devloping java applications

Eclipse - a IDE used mainly for java

Java Statements - instructions that tell the programming language what to do

Assignment statement - assigns a value to a variable

Java methods - blocks of code that perform a task, and can be used by other parts of a computer program

steps to writing a code:

1 - Understand the problem you are trying to solve
2 - Design a solution
3 - Draw a ow chart
4 - Write pseudo-code
5 - Write code
6 - Test and debug
7 - Test with real-world users
8 - Release program
9 - Iterate the steps for the next version

off by one - an error that happens when a loop or calculation goes one step too far or one step too short


double - data type used to store decimal numbers
e.g: double price = 19.99

function syntax in java:

<Access modifier> <keyword> <return type> <method name> (<parameters>){
<body>
}

public static void main(String[] args){
  system.out.println("hello world")
}

public - accessible anywhere

private - only inside the same class

static - belongs to a class not objects

abstract - has no body must be implemented by a subclass

void - no return value

compiler - a program that converts code, making it readable to a computer

indefinate loop - a loop that keeps running until a certain condition becomes false

definate loop - repeats a specific number of times


main method - the entry point of a java porgram it is where the program starts running . without it
              the program wont run

The main method in Java is declared as static because it allows the main method to be called as the first
method without having to create an instance of the method.


instance - gives the class its data and an object is the same thing as an instance

object - the same thing as a instance

inheritance - when a subclass/child class inherits a method from the parent class

encapsulation - is basically protecting data

polymorphism - the same thing can have different meaning such as communicate


difference between extend and implement:
extend - used when one class inherits from another class
implement - used when a class follows the rules of an interface

interface - is a mix of polymorphism and abstraction

representational independence - it should do what it represents. a time function should do time like things and should not
                                shuffle a deck of cards



nested static class - cannot directly access variables in the outer class it needs to refer to an instance of the outer class

non-static class - just a plain nested class


singly linked list - we can go from the head node to the tail node but not back and forth

doubly linked list - we can go back and forth between nodes

circularly linked list - we can go from head node to tail and tail to head


local class - a class delcared inside a method

static nested class - a class inside another class that doesnt depend on the outer class's objecct(useful for grouping helper
                      classes that are only related to the outer class logically)

shadowing - a local variable hides another variable with the same name from an outer scope

experimental analysis - testing an alorithm in practice to see how fast or efficeient it really is



The limitations of experimental analysis include:
1 - Implementing algorithms can be a tedious process.
2 - Hardware and software environments must be the same to compare algorithms (which is practically impossible).
3 - Input samples may not cover all the possible inputs and scenarios.

exponential search steps :
1 - start at the first element (index 0)
2 - check elements at exponential position (1,2,4,8,16) until u find a value bigger than or equal to the target
3 - once the range is found (e.g between indes 8 and 16) perform binary search in that range

stack - a kind of array that works like a stack of plates. A stack is an implementation of LIFO(last in first out)

LIFO - the last item you put in the stack is the first one you take out

queue - same as a stack but uses FIFO (First-in first-out)

FIFO - the first item you put in is the frst one you take out



add - adds a new item to the end of the queue -|- item is added but an exception is thrown if there is no room left

element - retrieves the item in front of the queue -|- item is retrieved but not removed

offer - adds a new item to the end of the queue -|- item is added but no exception is thrown if there is no room left

peek - retrieves the item in front of the queue -|- like element, item is retrieved but it is not removed and, will return null if empty

poll - retrieves and then removes the item in the front of the queue -|- item is retrieved, but if the queue is empty, null will be returned

remove - retrieves and then removes the item in the front of the queue -|- item is retrieved, but nothing is returned if the queue is empty


deque - is likea normal queue but u can add or remove elements from both ends. it can act as a FIFO or a LIFO

deep copy - creates a whole new array with the same contents

shallow copy - just copies the reference ofthe existing aray meaning both objects share it

positional list - is a technique almost the same as a doubly linked list but more abstract

hash set - is a kind of array where there must be no duplicates and elements are unordered

tree set - similar to hash set but the elements are automatically sorted

collection framework - a group of interfaces and classes that make it easy to store, organize, and manage data efficiently
                      like a toolbox of ready-made data structures


Binary trees - can have at most two children for each parent. Every node contains a 'left' reference, a 'right' reference, 
               and a data element

root node - The topmost node in the tree

leaf node - A node with no children


Full binary tree - Every node other than leaf nodes has 2 child nodes.

Complete binary tree - All levels are filled except possibly the last one, and all nodes are lled in as far left as possible.

Perfect binary tree - All nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.

traversal - moving through all nodes in a tree in a specific order

4 types of traversal order:
preorder - visit the root first, then move to the left subtree, then move to the right subtree 
        -|- root -> left -> right
inorder - visit the left subtree first, then the root, then the right subtree
       -|- left -> root -> right
postorder - visit the children first, then the root last 
         -|- left -> right -> root

seven experimental functions in algorithm analysis:
1 - f(n) = c or O(1) (constant) : time does not depend on the input size
    e.g: accessing an array element or using basic arithmetic operations

2 - f(n) = log n or O log (n) (logarithimic) - time grows slowly as input size increases
    e.g: using binary search

3 - O(n) (linear) - time grows proportionally with input size
    e.g: simple for-loop over array

4 - O(n log n) (linearithmic) - slightly faster than quadratic; common in efficient sorting algorithims
    e.g: sorting an array

5 - O(n^2) (quadratic) - time grows very quickly as input grows
    e.g: nested loop

6 - O(n^3) (cubic) - time grows extremely fast
    e.g: used in loops of 3 levels

7 - O(2^n) (exponential) - time doubles with extra input
    e.g: recursive fibonacci

contra positive - proving something by proving its opposite form

contra diction - we first assume that the given statement is false. We then later prove it to be 
                 true since the assumption leads us to a contradiction

loop vairants - a value that changes every time a loop runs and helps prove the loop will eventually
                stop

induction - technique used to prove a mathematical statement true using all available inputs.
            For example, if we assume a function A(x) to be true for all positive values of x, then through
            nite stepwise conditions, we can conclude that the statement is true

type casting - changing a variables data type to another

overloading - having multiple method with the same name but different parameters
              time grows slowly as input size increases

priority queue - a queue where elements are processed based on priority not the order they were added
                 and is often built using a heap for fast performance

Serializable - an interace that allows an object to be converted into bytes so it can be saved to a
               file, sent over a network, or stored and rebuilt later

natural order - means the default sorting order of objects like ascending for numbers or A-Z for strings
                as defined by their compareTo() method

heap - a binary tree where the parent node is always smaller or larger than is children. 
       mainly used to manage priorities like in PriorityQueue

min-heap - parent is always smaller than its children

max-heap - parent is always larger than its children

hash table - a data structure that stores data as key-value pairs

hash key - unique name or label u use to store and find a value in a hash table

hash function - is what the hash table uses to convert the key into a number (called hash code)

collision - happens when 2 keys get the same hash position(code) in a hash table

open addressing - method used in hash table to handle collisions instead of storing items in one slot
                  open adressing finds another emty slot in the table to store the new key

Empty - the slot has never been used and is empty

Occupied - the slot currently stores a key-value pairs

Deleted - the slot used to have a key but was removed

linear probing - move 1 step at a time

quadratic probing - jump by squares (power of 2)

double hashing - use a 2nd hash function to decide how far to jump next time (h1 + i * h2) % n

clustering - happens when many keys get stored close togetherin nearby slots forming a group (cluster)

modular hashing - we take the hash code of a key and then use the remainder when divided by the table size 
                  to find where to store it -|- index = hash(key) % tableSize

chaining - when 2 or more keys ge tthe same hash index we store all items together in a linked list
           at that index

robin hood hashing - a collision strategy that evens out probe distances by letting new keys "steal" slots
                     from keys closer to their ideal position improving fairness and consistency

probe counts - number  of attempts (or, probe) made to find an empty slot or key in the existing bucket

organ-pipe search - a technique to arrange data so that frequently searched items are near the center
                    of the list and the less used ones are at the edges, its names coming from the 
                    access pattern looking like the shape of organ pipe

lambda - a short anonymous function your able to pass around, usually to implement a functional interface


binary search tree - a data structure where each node has at most 2 children:
                     left childs value is smaller
                     the right childs value is larger

binary search key - the value youre looking for during a binary search or inside a binary search tree

sort map - a searchable collection of elements. The searchable elements are characterized by a 
           unique identier which is associated with the element

BST Operations:
    adding:
        1. start from the root
        2. if new value < current node -> go left
        3. if new value > current node -> go right
        4. if spot empty -> insert the new node
    
    searching:
        1. start at the root
        2. compare the search values with the current node
            - if its smaller -> go left
            - if its largere -> go right
            - if equal -> found
        3.stop when found or if u reach a null pointer(null)

    deletion:
        3 cases for deletion:
            1. node has no children -> just delete it
            2. node has one child -> replace node with its child
            3. node has 2 children:
                - find inorder successor (smallest node in right subtree)
                - replace node's value with that sucessor's value
                - delete the sucessor node

AVL trees - a self-balancing binary search tree where every node's left and right subtrees differ height
            by at most 1. it uses rotations to keep the tree balanced after insertions or deletions

4 types of rotations:
    1. LL(left-left)
        - node added to left of left child. fixes the right rotation
    2. RR(right-right)
        - node added to right of right child. fixes the left rotation
    3. LR(left-right)
        - node added to right of left child fixes the left right rotation(2 steps)
    4. RL(right-left)
        - nodeadded to left of right child fixes the right-left rotation(2 steps)


rotations - means turning the nodes around a point to restore balance after insertions or deletions

splay tree - a self-adjusting binary search tree that moves recently accessed elements closer to the 
             root using the operation called splaying 

zig - the nodes parent is the root, a single rotation brings the node to the root

zig-zag - the node is a child node and its parent is right node, or vice versa

zig-zig - the node and its parent are both left / right children, two rotations are performed in the same direction.

searh trees - a data structure used for storing data in ways making searching, insertion, and deletion efficient

multiway search trees - a multiway searh tree, balanced, as all leaves are at the same depth its a b-tree
                        of order four, (each node has <= 3 keys, <= 4 children)


search algorithm - a method used to find a specific item or piece of data within a collection, such as
                   a array, list, tree, or graph

primality testing algorithms - determining if a number (n) is prime

deterministic - always gives the correct answer

probabilistic methods - doesnt garuntee primality but aare very fast and almost always correct

sieve of eratosthenes - finds all prime numbers up to n and is 100% accurate

bubble sort - compares neighbors and swaps them until the list is sorted

selection sort - picks the minimum from the unsorted part and moves it to a sorted part

merge sort - splits the array, sorts each half and then merges them

quick sort - picks a pivot element, splits the array so that the numbers smaller than the pivot
             go to the left and numbers bigger go to the right

partition-exchange sort - just another name for quick sort

insertion sort - starts from the 2nd element, compare with element before it, shift the larger element
                 to the right, insert element into correct spot

immutable - can't be changed once it is created

brute-force algorithm - checking all possible solutions 

Boyer-moore algorithm - a fast string search algorithm that compares from the end and skips ahead using
                        mismatch rules

Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm (KMP) - searches for a pattern inside a text by using lps to avoid re-checking
                                     characters after mismatches

longest proper prex array - an array that tells kmp how much of the pattern has repeated so it can skip
                            ahead after mismatches instead of starting over

trie - a tree structure that stores strings efficiently by sharing common prefixes making word searches easy

trie node - stores a single character 

standard trie - basic version of prefix tree where each node represents a character, shares common 
                prefixes and mmarks the end words

compressed trie - stores sequences of characters in a single node instead of one character per node, 
                  reducing memory usage and speeding up searches compared to a standard tire

greedy algorithm - solves problems by choosing the best option at each step hoping it gives the best overall solution

graph theory - the study of graphs

vertices - nodes in a graph

isolated vertex - a vertex with no lines connecting it to others

adjacent vertices - This refers to connected vertices that are next to each other

degree of vertex - This tells us how many lines are connected to the vertex

even vertex - even number of vertex

odd vertex - odd number of vertex

edges - the lines in the graph

multiple edges - lines that connect the same vertices together

adjacent edges - edges that are next to each other

path - multiple edges

length of the path - number of edges we take

connected graph - a graph where all vertices are connected together

disconnected graph - a graph where all vertices are not connected together

components - a 2nd graph or subgraph

bridge - when we add a connection between 2 subgraph

loops - An edge that connects a vertex to itself. 

simple graph - nothing special just a graph with connection with no direction or weighted

weighted graph - a graph where each edge has a weight or cost (e.g: A - 5 - B , B - 2 - C , A - 8 - C)

directed graph - has edges with direction. edges are like arrows: A -> B means u can go from A to B
                 not the other way unless theres an arrow back

undirected graph - has edges with no directions if A is connected to B you can go both ways: A - B

adjacency matrix - a 2d table that shows all connections between vertices in a graph

adjacency list - a list that stores each vertex and the vertices it is connected to

Dijkstra's algorithm - finds the shortest distance from one node to every other connected node
                       as long as all edges weights are non-negative
    
    Dijkstra algorithm steps:
        1. start at a source vertex
        2. set its distance to 0 and all other distances to infinity (simply means no known path yet)
        3. repeatedly choose the closest unvisited vertex 
        4. update(relax) the distances to its neighbors:
            - if going through this vertex gives a shorter path -> update it
        5. mark the vertex as visited
        6. continue until all vertices are visited

Null graph - Also called an empty graph, a null graph is a graph in which there are no edges between
             any of its vertices.

Connected graph - A graph in which there is a path of edges between every pair of vertices in the
                  graph. Mary's graph is a connected graph, since there is a way to get from every 
                  city on the map to every other city.

Disconnected graph - A graph in which the path of edges does not always connect every vertex.

Bipartite graph - A graph that can be split into two sets of vertices such that edges only go between
                  sets, not within them.

Weighted graph - A graph in which weights, or numerical values, are assigned to each of the edges.
                 Mary's graph is a weighted graph, where the distances between the cities are the 
                 weights of the edges.

Directed graph - A graph in which the edges are directed by arrows, indicating that the relationship,
                 represented by the edge, only applies from one vertex to the other, but not the other 
                 way around. In other words, if a directed edge has an arrow from A to B, A is 
                 related to B, but B is not related to A.

Undirected graph - A graph whose edges are not directed. Mary's graph is an undirected graph,
                   because the routes between cities go both ways.

Simple graph - An undirected graph in which there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices,
               and there are no loops, which is an edge from a vertex to itself.

Multi-graph - A graph in which there are multiple edges between any pair of vertices or there are
              edges from a vertex to itself, also called a loop.

Planar graph - A graph that can be drawn so that all of the edges of the graph do not cross each other.

Nonplanar graph - A graph that is not a planar graph. In other words, a graph that cannot be drawn
                  without at least one pair of its edges crossing.



cyclic grpah - a directed graph that contains a path from at least one node back to itself 

acylic graph - a directed graph that contains absolutely no cycle; that is, no node can be traversed 
               back to itself.

dense graph - a graph where almost every node is connected to many other nodes

sparse graph - a graph where most nodes are NOT connected to many other nodes

memory management - the process of allocating memory to new Java objects and deallocating memory from
                    unused objects

stack memory - temporary memory for method excecution and local variables cleaned automatically
               when methods end

heap memory - where java puts objects and arrays managed by the garbage collector    X

garbage collector - the automatic system that deletes unused objects from the heap to free memory    

mark and sweep algorithm - a 2 step prcoess to remove unused objects from heap memory:
                           1 - mark phase -> find which objects are still in use
                           2 - sweep phase -> remove all objects that are NOT  marked

cache memory - ulta-fast memory that stores data the cpu needs soon, making the computer run much faster

web cache - stored website data that makes pages load faster and save bandwidth

cpu cache - very fast memory that reduces waiting time by keeping frequently used data close to the processor

cache hit - happens when the cpu successfully finds the data it needs inside the cache instead of
            going slower memory(RAM)

cache miss - happens when the cpu looks for data in the cache but the data is NOT there so it must fetch
             it from slower memory(RAM)

multi-level caches - refers to a cpu having multiple layers of cache memory(L1,L2,L3) to improve speed and efficiency
    L1 - fastest but smallest. located extremely close to the cpu cores
    L2 - slower than L1 but larger. can be priate per core or shared
    L3 - slowest but largest, but still much faster than RAM. shared by all cpu cores

external searching - searching data that is stored outside of main memory(like on hard disk or SSD)
                     because the data is too large to fit in RAM

B-trees - special type of balanced search tree designed for external memory

internal memory - primary memory of a computer that is directly accessible by the CPU

external memory - secondary storage of a computer used to store data permently or when it doesnt fit in 
                  internal memory

internal sorting - sorting method where all the data to be sorted fits into the main memory
