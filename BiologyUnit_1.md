# Biology Unit 1

## Scientific Method
A series of steps scientists can use as a guideline to solve a problem or examine a phenomenon.

### Steps of the Scientific Method:
1. **Observe**
2. **Ask a question**
3. **Develop a hypothesis**
4. **Make a prediction**
5. **Test the prediction**
6. **Repeat/Make new tests**
7. **Analyze and report**

### Key Terms:

**Hypothesis** - An educated guess or explanation of a phenomenon.

**Experiment** - A test set up to explain a phenomenon.

**Variable** - A factor in an experiment that can be changed or manipulated.

**Scientific Theory** - An explanation of an observation that has been rigorously tested.

**Fact** - A piece of information known to be true and that can be verified.

**Opinion** - A piece of information that involves personal judgment.

**Bias** - An opinion swayed by personal experience.

## Levels of Biological Organization

**Atom** - The basic unit of all living and non-living matter/chemicals.

**Molecule** - A group of atoms bonded together; a chemical compound.

**Cell** - The basic unit of life.

**Tissue** - Any of the distinct types of material of which animals or plants are made. Tissues are composed of many specialized cells.

**Organ** - Part of an organism, composed of many tissues, that is typically self-contained and has a specific vital function, such as the heart or liver in humans.

**Organ System** - A group of organs that work together to perform one or more specific functions. For example, the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves make up the nervous system, and together receive, process, and transmit information.

**Organism** - A single living thing, composed of one or more cells.

**Homeostasis** - An organism's ability to maintain a constant internal environment.

### Classification

**Vertebrate** - An organism that has a backbone.

**Invertebrate** - An organism that does not have a backbone.

## Body Systems

**Integumentary System** - The body system that composes the body's outer covering to protect the body, receives sensory information, and control body temperature.

**Skeletal System** - The body system that provides attachment points for muscles, stores minerals, protects organs and makes red blood cells.

**Cardiovascular System** - The body system that works to pump blood throughout the body.

**Endocrine System** - The body system that makes and secretes hormones which regulate body functioning.

**Lymphatic System** - The body system that works with the immune system to defend the body against disease.

**Respiratory System** - The body system that delivers oxygen and removes carbon dioxide from the body.

**Digestive System** - The body system that ingests, digests and absorbs nutrients needed in the body.

**Urinary System** - The body system that maintains the chemical makeup and volume of blood and rids the body of excess fluids.

**Reproductive System** - The body systems specific to male or females that produce sperm or eggs necessary for the formation of a fetus.

## Feedback Mechanisms

**Sensory Receptors** - Receptors located throughout your body that detect a stimulus.

**Integrator** - Your brain is the integrator that senses a stimulus and determines an appropriate response.

**Effectors** - Muscles or glands that carry out the response designated by the integrator.

**Negative Feedback** - A feedback mechanism that maintains homeostasis by reversing the change.

**Positive Feedback** - A feedback mechanism that intensifies a detected change.

## Cell Theory and Structure

**Cell Theory** - A theory that states all things are made of cells, cells are the smallest unit of life and all cells come from preexisting cells.

**Plasma Membrane** - The membrane that surrounds the outer body of the cell and controls what can enter and exit the cell.

**DNA** - A large molecule that contains all of an organism's genetic information.

**Cytoplasm** - The jelly-like substance found inside of a cell which holds all other organelles.

**Organelle** - A small, organized structure within a cell. A ribosome is an organelle found within both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells; a nucleus is an organelle found within eukaryotic cells, but not prokaryotic cells.

### Cell Types

**Eukaryotic Cells** - Type of cells which holds all of its genetic information (DNA) inside of a membrane-bound nucleus.

**Prokaryotic Cells** - Type of cells which does not contain a nucleus.

### Cell Membrane Structure

**Selectively Permeable** - A feature of the plasma membrane that allows it to regulate what crosses through it.

**Lipid Bilayer** - A membrane created by two layers of phospholipids.

**Phospholipid** - A lipid made of a hydrophilic (water-attracting) head and a hydrophobic (water-repelling) tail which make up the plasma membrane.
