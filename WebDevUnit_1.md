## Internet History and Development

### Early Technologies

**Microwave Transmission Technology** - Technology that uses electromagnetic waves.

### ARPANET

**ARPANET** - Microwave transmission technology was unreliable so ARPANET needed a method to transmit information reliably in case of an attack. They created a network "ARPANET" that connected multiple universities together for research.

### Space Race and Technology

**Sputnik** - The world's first satellite developed by the Soviet Union in 1957.

## Internet Protocols

### Communication Protocols

**HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** - A communication protocol designed for the World Wide Web for transferring data files and assets between computer systems.

**TCP/IP** - The internet's communication backbone, where TCP ensures reliable data delivery and IP handles addressing and routing.

### Web Infrastructure

**World Wide Web (WWW)** - A collection of information and resources that are accessible over the Internet. Also called Web, WWW, and W3.

## Technology Trends

### Moore's Law

**Moore's Law** - The number of transistors on a microchip doubles about every two years.
