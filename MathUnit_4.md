Monomial An expression containing a single term, The prefix "mono" means "one". A monopoly is a market that is controlled by a single company, A monocle is eye-wear that consists of only one lens.

Polynomial An expression with several terms, The prefix "poly" means "many." 
A polytheistic religion believes in many deities

QUESTION:
Rewrite the following polynomial expression so that it is in proper order and also determine the degree:

Here, we see a first-degree term, followed by a second-degree term, followed by a third-degree term. We need to write the terms in order of descending degree (highest to lowest):

The degree of this polynomial is 3.

Degree (of a Polynomial) Also called order, the highest degree of the terms in a polynomial expression

Like terms
same variables which are raised to the same power, i.e 2x^2 and 7x^2 are like terms, in order to combine them, you have to add their coefficients (meaning the base number.), if the coefficients are negative, we can think of it as subtraction.

QUESTION
Add the following two polynomials:

Let's first set this up by writing the problem vertically:

Before we complete the addition, let's take a closer look at the vertical set up. The whole point of writing the addition vertically is to line up the like terms. But notice that there are some terms in one polynomial that are not in the other, so like terms are not lining up together. In this case, it helps to write a term with a coefficient of zero as a placeholder to keep everything vertically aligned.

Now we can add the two polynomials together, combining the coefficients of like terms:

QUESTION
Subtract the following two polynomials:

Once again, we'll write the problem vertically and add terms with coefficients of 0 to keep everything aligned. It also helps to group each polynomial in parentheses, so that we can get the subtraction out in front and still be aware of the signs of each term within the polynomial

Now we can subtract the two polynomials, evaluating for the coefficients of like terms:

Was any part of that subtraction tricky? It was probably easy enough to get the coefficients of the first two terms:


However, sometimes it can be difficult to remember signs with subtraction, especially for the last two coefficients:

QUESTION

As you read through the steps, think about how the process is similar to numeric long division.






At this point, we repeat our steps of dividing, multiplying, subtracting, and bringing down the next term:





We repeat the cycle of steps once again:





Synthetic division
a process that is designed to be easier than polynomial long division



steps:
1. Set up synthetic division using coefficients of the dividend polynomial and the constant term of the divisor. 2. Bring the first number in the box down below. 3. Multiply this number by the value to the left of the box. 4. Write the product below the next number in the box. 5. Add vertically, and write this below the box. 6. Repeat these steps until there are no more operations left to do.

QUESTION

First, use the coefficients of the dividend (what is being divided) and write them inside of a box, as shown below:

Next, we write in the value for "a" in our general (x - a) form for the divisor (what we are dividing by). Because we generally say (x - a), if the factor we are dividing by has a plus sign, the value of "a" is actually negative. Since we are dividing by x + 3, then our divisor is actually -3.

Bring the first number, 2, down below.


Multiply 2 by the value to the left of the box, -3, which equals -6. Write this product below the next number in the box, 3.

Add 3 and -6 vertically, which equals -3. Write this below the box.

We repeat this process to complete the table:
