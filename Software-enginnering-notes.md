- Software Engineering
The field of designing, creating, testing, and maintaining software.

     - 1. Understanding Customer Requirements
     communicating with the customer before building a software, so you get to know their requirements thoroughly.
     This step is connected with [CRS] in order for the customer to properly specify what they need.

     - 2. Requirement Analysis: Is the Project Feasible?
     Analysing and exploring issues related to the financial, technical, operational, and time
     management aspects of software development.
       
     - 3. Creating a Design
     Creating a blueprint for the future software with designs, low or high level of architecture and components.

     - 4. Coding, Testing, and Installation
     Implementing the design by writing code, testing if it meets requirement,
     then debugging, and finally, releasing the software on a server.
     
     - 5. Keeping it Going: Maintenance
     Updating and improving the software by fixing issues and adding new features as needed.




- Software Development Life Cycle [SDLC]
framework for building software properly, describing the entire life of a software program, from the moment someone has an idea for it,
to the time it is used, updated, and eventually replaced.

- Software Process

     - Software specification
     The identication of the requirements of the system and the limitations
     within which the system will operate, develop, or can evolve. 
                . Feasibility studies       : Guides the ultimate decision as to whether to progress with the development or not.
                . Requirements Analysis     : Ensures the system in question is properly understood.
                . Requirement specification : All the information gathered so far is translated into a document that clearly states all the system requirements
                . Requirements Validation   : Checks that the requirements developed are consistent and complete.

     - Software design and implementation
    The software is designed and programming developed. 
                . Architectural Design      : The overall design of the system: main components, subsystems, and their interrelationships.
                . Interface Design          : The development of interfaces through which the dierent components of the system relate to each other. 
                . Component Design          : Subsystems and components are designed at this stage and their operational modes established.
                . Database Design           : The systems data structures are designed and represented in a database.

     - Software validation
    validation ensures that the software developed complies with the design specications and the expectations of the system user.
                . Development Testing       : Developers test all components and sub-systems that make up the system. 
                . System Testing            : This testing checks for errors, unpredictable system behaviors.
                . Acceptance Testing        : With real data in use, this stage of testing can uncover requirement shortfalls and omissions.

   - 2. System Model Design
   - 3. Evaluation of Alternative Options
   - 4. Detailed System Developement and Design






##                ____________________ FILE 5 ____________________ 







System Developement Life Cycle [SDLC]
        
      . Planning        : This step begins with requirements gathering, Once they're answered, the information is presented to management for project approval.
      . Analysis        : Everything is documented and the systems design document is discussed with management to get their blessing.
      . Design          : Figure out what the network, application software, user interfaces, and system interfaces will look like. 
      . Implementation  : This is the phase where the code is actually written, screen layouts are tested and interfaces between programs are tested.
      . Maintenance     : Once the system is installed, support plans are put in place either with internal IT staff or external vendors.

- Object Oriented Analysis and Design [OOAD]
a way of analyzing, designing, and building software by thinking in terms of objects, just like real-world things.

- Object Oriented Programming [OOP]

      . Objects                 : Concrete things that are found in the real world, such as a student, a customer or a product
      . Functions or Behaviors  : Define actions that will usually have some outcome; for example, a student will provide a name and unique admission number
      . Classes                 : Describe objects into groupings that have some common functions or behaviors
      . Instantiation           : An object is described as a real life representation of a given class;


- What is the Difference Between **Object Oriented Analysis and Design** [OOAD] and **Object Oriented Programming** [OOP] ?
OOAD is like this— it is the process before the coding happens. It stands for Object-Oriented Analysis and Design— Which, of course concludes the two steps, analysis, and design.
In analysis, we analyze and take the information of the project, like if building a house, they ask how much the owner cooks, how many bathrooms, etc.

Meanwhile, OOP is more like this— it is the process of the coding. It stands for Object-Oriented programming, and it is basically like the coding, the whole process.
it uses techniques like encapsulation, inheritance, and more!

- Software Development Life Cycle 
basically a guide or structured process that shows how software is
planned, developed, tested, released, and maintained step by step.


- System Development Life Cycle [SDLC]
        . Planning          : This phase checks whether the project is feasible and evaluates constraints to decide if the project can realistically be carried out.

        . Analysis          : It identifies what the system should do, ensuring the requirements fit the budget and available technology.

        . Design            : The design phase creates a blueprint of the system. Requirements are converted into diagrams and models that guide development.

        . Implementation    : The software is developed according to the design and tested until it meets quality standards and satisfies the customer.

        . Maintenance       : The project team defines the tasks and procedures that are going to be followed in order to keep the system running efficiently.


- User Stories
often used to describe the desired functionality. User stories have the structure of:
     ### FORMAT: As a <user>, I want <functionality> so that <value / reason>.
     ### EX: As a Student, I want to bookmark my lessons so that i can find them easily.


##                ____________________ FILE 8 ____________________

the structured process of creating and maintaining an entire information system, including software, hardware, and processes.

        . Waterfall Model                : A linear and sequential model where each phase is completed before moving to the next.
        . V-Model                        : An extension of the Waterfall Model that emphasizes testing. Each development phase has a testing phase, forming a V shape.
        . Iterative & Incremental Model  : Software is developed in small parts (increments) through repeated cycles (iterations). 
        . Software Prototype Model       : A prototype (early version) of the software is built to understand user requirements. 
        . Spiral Model                   : A risk-driven model that combines iterative development with risk analysis.
                                           The project progresses in loops (spirals), each focusing on planning, risk assessment, development, and evaluation.


- Prototype
a preliminary model [something that comes before something else] of a system used to test ideas and refine requirements before full development.

- Agile
a development methodology that delivers software in small, iterative increments with continuous feedback and adaptability.

- Rapid Application Development [RAD]
a software development model that rapidly builds applications using prototyping and continuous user feedback.

      . Stage   : a process pattern that focuses on the actions or activities needed to realize each phase. 
      . Task    : a process pattern that focuses on an individual action or activity within each stage.


- Examples of Process Patterns
      . Peer Review  : Group of team members examine and discuss a deliverable to check quality, find errors, and suggest improvements before it moves forward.
      . Rework       : A deliverable is sent back for correction because defects or issues were found.
      . Delivery     : The final deliverable(s) are handed over to the customer or end users, formally completing that part of the project.
      . Kick-Off     : Team members and stakeholders meet at the start of a project to confirm goals, roles, scope, and officially begin the project.

- The Incremental Model
way of building software step by step where instead of creating the whole software at once, the system is developed in small parts (increments), each part adding new features.

- Muddling Through
An idea invented by **Charles Lindblom,** made for making decisions by trying small changes instead of making one big perfect plan.


- Three Decision - Making Phases

     - Identification Phase 
     At the first phase, the problem is identified and explored.

               . Recognition       : When a manager in the organization becomes aware of a problem or situation requiring a decision.
               . Diagnosis         : Information is gathered about the problem, Depending on the size of the problem and availability of resources,
                                                    this may be more or less detailed and take more or less time.
 
     - Development Phase
     During the second phase, a solution is created for the existing problem.

               . Search or Screen  : Past solutions are reviewed and existing templates, procedures, or examples are reused. Sometimes  only small modifications may be needed.
               . Design            : If no suitable existing solution is found, the decision-maker must design a new solution from scratch.

     - Selection Phase
     During this phase, the decision is made. If several alternatives were available, a choice of the best suitable solution is made.
               . Judgement         : Judgement is used when There is one main decision-maker, the decision is based on experience and intuition and formal analysis is not required.
               . Analysis          : Criteria are defined, Each option is compared using data or scoring, The most suitable option is selected objectively.
               . Bargaining        : Bargaining occurs when multiple decision-makers are involved, opinions differ and conflict exists.
      . Authorization     : finish
