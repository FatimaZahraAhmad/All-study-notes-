- System Analysis
The process of studying a system to understand how it works and what it needs to do.


- Software Process

     - Software specification
     The identication of the requirements of the system and the limitations
     within which the system will operate, develop, or can evolve. 
                . Feasibility studies       : Guides the ultimate decision as to whether to progress with the development or not.
                . Requirements Analysis     : Ensures the system in question is properly understood.
                . Requirement specification : All the information gathered so far is translated into a document that clearly states all the system requirements
                . Requirements Validation   : Checks that the requirements developed are consistent and complete.

     - Software design and implementation
    The software is designed and programming developed. 
                . Architectural Design      : The overall design of the system: main components, subsystems, and their interrelationships.
                . Interface Design          : The development of interfaces through which the dierent components of the system relate to each other. 
                . Component Design          : Subsystems and components are designed at this stage and their operational modes established.
                . Database Design           : The systems data structures are designed and represented in a database.

     - Software validation
    validation ensures that the software developed complies with the design specications and the expectations of the system user.
                . Development Testing       : Developers test all components and sub-systems that make up the system. 
                . System Testing            : This testing checks for errors, unpredictable system behaviors.
                . Acceptance Testing        : With real data in use, this stage of testing can uncover requirement shortfalls and omissions.

- Software Development Life Cycle 
basically a guide or structured process that shows how software is 
planned, developed, tested, released, and maintained step by step.


- System Development Life Cycle [SDLC]
        . Planning          : This phase checks whether the project is feasible and evaluates constraints to decide if the project can realistically be carried out.

        . Analysis          : It identifies what the system should do, ensuring the requirements fit the budget and available technology.

        . Design            : The design phase creates a blueprint of the system. Requirements are converted into diagrams and models that guide development.

        . Implementation    : The software is developed according to the design and tested until it meets quality standards and satisfies the customer.

        . Maintenance       : The project team defines the tasks and procedures that are going to be followed in order to keep the system running efficiently.


- User Stories
often used to describe the desired functionality. User stories have the structure of:
     ### FORMAT: As a <user>, I want <functionality> so that <value for the user/reason>.
    #### EX: As a Student, I want to bookmark my lessons so that i can find them easily.


##                ____________________ FILE 8 ____________________

        . V-Model                        : An extension of the Waterfall Model that emphasizes testing. Each development phase has a testing phase, forming a V shape.
        . Iterative & Incremental Model  : Software is developed in small parts (increments) through repeated cycles (iterations). 
        . Software Prototype Model       : A prototype (early version) of the software is built to understand user requirements. 
        . Spiral Model                   : A risk-driven model that combines iterative development with risk analysis.
                                           The project progresses in loops (spirals), each focusing on planning, risk assessment, development, and evaluation.

- The Incremental Model
way of building software step by step in which, instead of creating the whole software at once, the system is developed in small parts (increments),
and each part adds new features.

- Muddling Through
An idea invented by **Charles Lindblom,** made for making decisions by trying small changes instead of making one big perfect plan.


- Three Decision - Making Phases

     - Identification Phase 
     At the first phase, the problem is identified and explored.

               . Recognition       : When a manager in the organization becomes aware of a problem or situation requiring a decision.
               . Diagnosis         : Information is gathered about the problem, Depending on the size of the problem and availability of resources,
                                                    this may be more or less detailed and take more or less time.
 
     - Development Phase
     During the second phase, a solution is created for the existing problem.

               . Search or Screen  : Past solutions are reviewed and existing templates, procedures, or examples are reused. Sometimes  only small modifications may be needed.
               . Design            : If no suitable existing solution is found, the decision-maker must design a new solution from scratch.

     - Selection Phase
     During this phase, the decision is made. If several alternatives were available, a choice of the best suitable solution is made.
               . Judgement         : Judgement is used when There is one main decision-maker, the decision is based on experience and intuition and formal analysis is not required.
               . Analysis          : Criteria are defined, Each option is compared using data or scoring, The most suitable option is selected objectively.
               . Bargaining        : Bargaining occurs when multiple decision-makers are involved, opinions differ and conflict exists.
      . Authorization     : finish
