# Mathematics Unit 1

## Number Types and Properties

### Types of Numbers

**Natural Numbers** - The numbers 1, 2, 3, ....

**Whole Numbers** - The natural numbers with 0 included.

**Integers** - The natural numbers and their opposites, with zero included. (Every integer is rational)

**Rational Number** - Any number that can be expressed as a fraction.

**Irrational Numbers** - Numbers which cannot be represented as a ratio of integers.

**Real Numbers** - Numbers that can be expressed as a decimal and placed on the number line.

### Key Concepts

**Absolute Value** - The distance between a number and zero on the number line; it is always non-negative.

**Conversion Factor** - A fraction equal to one that is multiplied by a quantity to convert it into an equivalent quantity in different units.

**PEMDAS** - An acronym to remember the order of operations: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, addition and subtraction.

**Pi (π)** - The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter; approximately equal to 3.14.

**Scientific Notation** - A way to express numbers as the product of a decimal number and a power of 10.

## Operations and Expressions

### Basic Operations

**Product** - The result of multiplying two or more numbers together.

**Exponent** - Indicates how many times a base number should be multiplied by itself. For example, in 4², the exponent is 2, meaning multiply 4 by itself 2 times.

**Base** - The number that is multiplied by itself in an exponent operation.

**Quotient** - The result you get when you divide one number by another; essentially fractions.

**Reciprocal** - The reciprocal of a number is 1 divided by that number.

### Radical Expressions

**Radicand** - The expression underneath a radical sign.

**Index** - The number contained to the left side of a radical expression that indicates the root being taken.

**Definition of Radicals**: If you take a number and find its y-th root to get x, then x multiplied by itself y times should give back the original number.

## Geometry Concepts

### Basic Shapes

**Area** - The space inside a shape (such as a triangle, rectangle, or square).

**Base** - The length of the bottom side of a shape.

**Height** - A line from the top point of a shape straight down to the base, making a right angle with the base.

**Vertex** - A point where two straight lines meet.

## Number Systems

### Different Base Systems

**Base 10 Numbers** - Also called decimal values, these are numbers using 10 digits that go from 0 to 9.

**Base 2 Numbers** - Also called binary numbers, these are numbers using two digits, 0 or 1.

**Base 8 Numbers** - Also called octal numbers, these are numbers using 8 digits, going from 0 to 7.

**Base 16 Numbers** - Also called hexadecimal numbers, these are any numbers using 10 digits (0 to 9) and 6 letters (A, B, C, D, E, and F).
