It is considered bad practice to have a radical in the denominator of a fraction. When this happens we multiply the numerator and denominator by the same thing in order to clear the radical.

If the binomial is in the numerator the process to rationalize the denominator is essentially the same as with monomials. The only difference is we will have to distribute in the numerator.


Commutative Property A property of addition that allows terms to be added in any order; a property of multiplication that allows factors to be multiplied in any order.

Reciprocal
The reciprocal of any number is called 1 divided by that number.

Associative Property A property of addition that allows terms to be grouped in any order; a property of multiplication that allows factors to be grouped in any order.

Distributive Property A property of multiplication that states that a sum multiplied by a factor can be expressed as a sum of the products of each individual addend and that factor.

During the 5th century BC in India, Aryabhata published a treatise on astronomy. His work included a method for finding the square root of numbers that have many digits.

Conjugate The conjugate of a binomial is a binomial with the opposite sign between its terms.

FOIL An acronym to remember the steps for distributing factors in binomial multiplication: first, outside, inside, last.

Algebraic Expression A combination of numbers, variables, and operators representing a quantity.
Variable A quantity that can change, expressed as a letter or symbol.
Factor A number or quantity used in multiplication.

Coefficient The number in front of a variable term that acts as a factor or multiplier.
Constant A term with no variable component.
Term A collection of numbers, variables, and powers combined through multiplication.

Monomial An expression with only one term

4x^2 would be called a second-degree monomial because the variable is being raised to the second power.

Binomial An expression with two terms

Polynomial An expression containing several terms.

Equation A mathematical statement that two quantities or expressions are equal in value.


Often as we work with problems, there will be a set of parentheses that make solving a problem difficult, if not impossible. To get rid of these unwanted parentheses, we can use the distributive property. Using this property, we multiply the number in front of the parentheses by each term inside.

Rule of Equality Any operation performed on one side of the equation must be performed on the other side, in order to keep quantities equal in value.

To solve single-step equations, first identify the operation being applied to the variable. To isolate the variable, apply the inverse operation. Addition and subtraction are inverses of each other; multiplication and division are inverses of each other.

Inequality A mathematical statement that two quantities are not equal in value.


endpoint is not included in linterval
open circle
( or )
< or >


endpoint is included in linterval
closed circle
[ or ] 
≤ or ≥

The vertical bar ∣ (read as "such that") separates the variable from the condition that x must satisfy.

The curly bracket { indicates that we are defining a set.


Compound inequalities have two or more inequalities.


"OR" inequalities also have two or more inequalities, but the solution set satisfies any but not necessarily all of the inequalities

"AND" inequalities, only the overlapping parts of the individual graphs makes it to the final number line

When you're solving another "AND" inequality with an algebraic expression between two inequality symbols, any operation done between the symbols must also be done on the other side of both inequality symbols.





Arithmetic Sequence A set of numbers in numerical order, with a common difference between each term.
Common Difference The numerical distance between any two consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence, a constant value.





Sequence A set of numbers in a particular order.
Series The sum of the first n terms in a sequence.



Sigma: This notation tells us to sum the values of terms in a sequence, starting with the first term and ending with the fifth term. How was this information drawn out from this notation? The big E-like symbol is the Greek letter sigma. This is what tells us to sum, or add

What to sum: What exactly are we summing? That's written directly to the right of sigma. The represents the value of the n-th term to a sequence.

Lower index: Below is the lower index, which tells us where to start summing. In this case, the lower index is 1.

Upper index: Above is the upper index, which tells us where to stop summing. In this case, the upper index is 5.


Summation Notation An expression of a series, using the Greek letter sigma, and a lower and upper index to indicate the first and last terms of the sum.




arithmetic sequences & college algebra in context,

distance, rate, and time.

























A conversion factor is a fraction equivalent to 1. 

A unit rate is a ratio between two quantities with different units, here are some examples (the numerator is the distance, or any other unit, and the denominator is the speed, )

1. Dollars per hour, such as $17.50/1 hr
2. Words per minute, such as 200 wrds/ 1 min
3. Calories per serving, such as 250 clres/1 serve
4. Steps per day, such as 3,000 stps/1 day
