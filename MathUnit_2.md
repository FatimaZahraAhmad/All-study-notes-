# Mathematics Unit 2

## Algebraic Expressions and Properties

### Basic Properties

**Commutative Property** - A property of addition that allows terms to be added in any order; a property of multiplication that allows factors to be multiplied in any order.

**Associative Property** - A property of addition that allows terms to be grouped in any order; a property of multiplication that allows factors to be grouped in any order.

**Distributive Property** - A property of multiplication that states that a sum multiplied by a factor can be expressed as a sum of the products of each individual addend and that factor.

### Algebraic Terms and Expressions

**Algebraic Expression** - A combination of numbers, variables, and operators representing a quantity.

**Variable** - A quantity that can change, expressed as a letter or symbol.

**Factor** - A number or quantity used in multiplication.

**Coefficient** - The number in front of a variable term that acts as a factor or multiplier.

**Constant** - A term with no variable component.

**Term** - A collection of numbers, variables, and powers combined through multiplication.

### Types of Expressions

**Monomial** - An expression with only one term.

- Example: 4x² would be called a second-degree monomial because the variable is being raised to the second power.

**Binomial** - An expression with two terms.

**Polynomial** - An expression containing several terms.

### Working with Binomials

**Conjugate** - The conjugate of a binomial is a binomial with the opposite sign between its terms.

**FOIL** - An acronym to remember the steps for distributing factors in binomial multiplication: First, Outside, Inside, Last.

## Equations and Inequalities

### Equations

**Equation** - A mathematical statement that two quantities or expressions are equal in value.

**Rule of Equality** - Any operation performed on one side of the equation must be performed on the other side, in order to keep quantities equal in value.

**Solving Single-Step Equations**: First identify the operation being applied to the variable. To isolate the variable, apply the inverse operation. Addition and subtraction are inverses of each other; multiplication and division are inverses of each other.

### Inequalities

**Inequality** - A mathematical statement that two quantities are not equal in value.

#### Inequality Notation

**Open Interval** (endpoint not included):
- Open circle on number line
- Parentheses: ( or )
- Symbols: < or >

**Closed Interval** (endpoint included):
- Closed circle on number line
- Brackets: [ or ]
- Symbols: ≤ or ≥

#### Set Builder Notation

**Vertical Bar ∣** - Read as "such that", separates the variable from the condition that x must satisfy.

**Curly Bracket {** - Indicates that we are defining a set.

### Compound Inequalities

**Compound Inequalities** - Have two or more inequalities.

**"OR" Inequalities** - Have two or more inequalities, but the solution set satisfies any but not necessarily all of the inequalities.

**"AND" Inequalities** - Only the overlapping parts of the individual graphs make it to the final number line.

**Solving "AND" Inequalities**: When you're solving an "AND" inequality with an algebraic expression between two inequality symbols, any operation done between the symbols must also be done on the other side of both inequality symbols.

## Radicals and Rationalization

### Working with Radicals

**Rationalizing Denominators**: It is considered bad practice to have a radical in the denominator of a fraction. When this happens we multiply the numerator and denominator by the same thing in order to clear the radical.

**Binomials in Numerator**: If the binomial is in the numerator the process to rationalize the denominator is essentially the same as with monomials. The only difference is we will have to distribute in the numerator.

### Historical Context

**Aryabhata's Method**: During the 5th century BC in India, Aryabhata published a treatise on astronomy. His work included a method for finding the square root of numbers that have many digits.

## Sequences and Series

### Basic Concepts

**Sequence** - A set of numbers in a particular order.

**Series** - The sum of the first n terms in a sequence.

### Arithmetic Sequences

**Arithmetic Sequence** - A set of numbers in numerical order, with a common difference between each term.

**Common Difference** - The numerical distance between any two consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence, a constant value.

### Summation Notation

**Sigma (Σ)** - The Greek letter sigma tells us to sum, or add values of terms in a sequence.

**Summation Notation Components**:
- **What to sum**: Written directly to the right of sigma, represents the value of the n-th term in a sequence.
- **Lower index**: Below sigma, tells us where to start summing.
- **Upper index**: Above sigma, tells us where to stop summing.

**Summation Notation** - An expression of a series, using the Greek letter sigma, and a lower and upper index to indicate the first and last terms of the sum.

## Applications and Rate Problems

### Conversion and Rates

**Conversion Factor** - A fraction equivalent to 1.

**Unit Rate** - A ratio between two quantities with different units.

**Examples of Unit Rates**:
1. **Dollars per hour** - Such as $17.50/1 hr
2. **Words per minute** - Such as 200 words/1 min
3. **Calories per serving** - Such as 250 calories/1 serving
4. **Steps per day** - Such as 3,000 steps/1 day
