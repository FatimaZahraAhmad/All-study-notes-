- Tautology 
A statement that is always TRUE no matter what happens.
### EX: Truth tables and statements like "I will either get paid, or i will NOT get paid." which is both going to be true no matter what.




##                ____________________ FILE 2 ____________________ 



- Logical Fallacies
Flaws in reasoning that render arguments invalid or unsound.


- Hasty generalization 
Drawing a broad conclusion from too little evidence. Taking one or a few cases and applying it to an entire group. 


- Circular Reasoning 
The conclusion is the same as the premise. The argument assumes what it's trying to prove. A proves A because A.     


- False Cause 
Assuming that because one thing happened after another, the first caused the second. Confusing "after" with "because of." Correlation mistaken for causation.


- Limited Choice
Presenting only two options when more exist. Framing a complex issue as black-and-white, with no middle ground.





##                ____________________ FILE 3 ____________________ 





- Appeal to Ignorance
Depicting if something was true or false just because there wasn't enough evidence or knowledge for that person to prove it. 
### EX: A child comes up to you and says 2 + 4 = 24, because in their mind, the plus means putting the numbers next to each other. They don't have the knowledge of the plus signs, so they say the equation is true.

- Appeal to Emotion
Depicting if something was true or falsed based on just your emotions or what you feel when you come across your conclusion.
### EX: telling your teacher that your answer is right because you felt a strong emotion when you came across it. You need factual arguments about your conclusion in order to prove that it is right.


- Appeal to Popularity
Depicting if something was true or false just by popular opinions on the topic, or when alot of people around you belive in that answer.
### EX: A doughnut shop is popular and alot of people say the donuts are fantastic. the donuts might be fantastic! Everyone around you says 2 + 2 = 5. Does it make it true just because everyone around you says so? No.





##                ____________________ FILE 4 ____________________ 



- Propositions
A statement that affirms or denies something and is either true or false. [Not questions, commands, or other things.]


- Negation 
A statement that is a refusal or denial of some other statement, that adds a NOT in the statement.
### EX: 'Maria has a blue dog', 'Maria does NOT have a blue dog.'


- Truth Value
A true or false value.

- Truth Table
A table showing the truth value for logical combinations for propositions.


- p AND q
Both propositions must be happening at the same time in order to be true.


- p OR q
Either or both propositions must be happening in order to be true.


- if p, then q
The second proposition will only happen if the first proposition happens.


- p if and only if q
either proposition only happen if the other happens as well.




##                ____________________ FILE 5 ____________________ 




- Statement
A phrase that can be labeled as either true or false.


- Conjunction
An 'AND' statement that combines two propositions that are only true when both are true.


- Disjunction 
An 'OR' statement that combines two propositions that are only true when at least one of them are true.



##                ____________________ FILE 6 ____________________ 




- Conditional Statement 
A statement that joins two events together based on a condition and uses the if-then structure. 
### EX: If Carlos walks to work instead of driving, then his gas money will decrease.


- Hypothesis
The first event or occurance of a conditional statement, the 'if' statement.
### EX: Carlos walks to work.

- Conclusion
The second event or occurance of a conditional statement, the 'then' statement.
### EX: His gas money will decrease. 




##                ____________________ FILE 7 ____________________ 



- Logical Equivalence
The identical truth values between two statements in all possible casess
### EX: If i were sitting on my floor, i'd be at home   /   If i were not in my home, i would not be sitting on my floor.


- Converse
The switching of the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement.
### EX: If i were at home, i would be sitting on my floor.


- Inverse
The negative form of the conditional in which both hypothesis and conclusion are negated.
### EX: If i were not sitting on my floor, then i would not be at home.


- Contrapositive
Both the switching, and negating of the hypothesis and conclusions in a sentence.
### EX: If i were not in my home, i would not be sitting on my floor.


- Counterexample
A specific example that proves a statement to be wrong / false.
### EX: If im sitting on my floor, i am home. BUT, im sitting on my couch, so im not home.



##                ____________________ FILE 8 ____________________ 





- Direct Proof 
Assume the hypothesis is true, Use logic and known facts, Show the conclusion follows.

##                ____________________ FILE 1 ____________________ 


- Set 
A collection of objects.


- Union 
The term used when uniting two sets together.


- Intersection 
The term used when putting two sets identical items together.





##                ____________________ FILE 2 ____________________ 



- Universal set 
A set of all elements that are under consideration for a articular problem or situation.




##                ____________________ FILE 3 ____________________ 


- Complement
a set of elements of the universal set that are not elements of another.



##                ____________________ FILE 4 ____________________ 



- Set 
A collection of elements.


- Element
A collection of various types of items.


- Cardinality 
The size/number of elements in a set 


- Empty set 
A set with no contents. empty.


- Finite set 
A set that you can count up to.


- Infinite set 
A set that goes forever.


- Equal sets 
Two sets that Have the exact same elements. 


- Equivalent sets
Two sets that have the exact same number of elements.




##                ____________________ FILE 5 ____________________ 




- Cartesian Product 
All possible ordered pairs you can make by taking one item from set A and one from set B.


- Reflexive
Every element of a set related to itself.


- Anti-Symmetric
A rule that says two different things cannot point to each other at the same time.
### EX: Sam is older then Bell. Bell is younger then Sam. [A NOT Anti-Symmetric would say that bell is also older then sam,but that can only be true if they are the same person. two people cannot be older then each other.]


- Transitive 
Another rule saying :
### EX: If A knows B, and B knows C, Then A should know C.


- Partial Order Relation [POSET]
The combination rules of the three : Reflexive, Anti-Symmetric, and Transitive.


- Hasse diagram
a simple clean way of drawing a poset, so you can see its structure without drawing everything.


- Maximal Element 
an element with nothing strictly greater than it in the poset.
In Hasse diagram: the top-level dots with no lines coming out upward.


- Minimale Element 
an element with nothing strictly less than it in the poset.
In Hasse diagram: the bottom-level dots with no lines coming in from below.


- Join Semilattice
A POSET that can find any two element's smallest boss. [The smallest boss being the smallest element that is still above them, also called the join.]


- Meet Semilattice
A POSET that can find any two element's biggest subordinate. [The biggest boss being the biggest element that is still above them, also called the meet.]


- Lattice 
A POSET where any two elements always have both a smallest common boss above [join] and a biggest common helper below [meet].



##                ____________________ FILE 7 ____________________ 


- Injection 
One-to-One, Different inputs → different outputs. No two inputs share the same output (nothing gets "doubled up").


- Surjection 
Onto, Every possible output in the codomain (ending set) is actually hit by at least one input.
Nothing in the ending set is left out — everything gets used.


- Bijection 
One-to-One + Onto = Perfect Matching, Both injective and surjective at the same time. One-to-one and covers everything perfectly.


- isomorphism
A bijective that keeps the structure the same: 
whatever operation/relation holds in A also holds in B after applying f (and vice versa, since there's an inverse).

##                ____________________ FILE 1 ____________________ 




- Sequence 
An ordered list of numbers (or sometimes other things) that follow a specific pattern or rule.

    * Infinite Sequence : Goes on forever — no last term (it keeps going with ... at the end).
    * Finite Sequence   : Has a definite end — only a specific, limited number of terms.


- Terms 
A single number / item in a Sequence.


- Arithmetic Sequences 
A sequence where each term increases (or decreases) with addition or subtraction by the same fixed amount every time.
### EX: 2, 7, 11, 15, 19, ... (Each term adds 4)


- Geometric Sequences 
A sequence where each term increases (or decreases) with multiplication by the same fixed amount every time.
### EX: 5, 10, 20, 40, 80


- Fibonacci Sequence 
A famous infinite sequence where each term is the sum of the two previous terms.


- Recursive Sequence
any sequence where each term is defined using previous terms (instead of a direct formula for the nth term).

- Linear Relationship
means two things change in a straight-line way — when one increases (or decreases) by a fixed amount, the other does the same.


- Common Difference 
the fixed amount you add (or subtract) to get from one term to the next in an arithmetic sequence.




##                ____________________ FILE 4 ____________________ 



 


- Common Ratio 
the fixed number you multiply by to get from one term to the next in a geometric sequence.



##                ____________________ FILE 5 ____________________ 


- Series

- Sigma Notation / Summation Notation
the specific way mathematicians use the uppercase Greek letter Σ (big sigma) as a
shortcut symbol for "add up a bunch of terms" according to a pattern.
