# Lines in the Plane



## Distance Between Two Points

- Distance
The length of a line segment between 2 points.

- Distance on a Number Line
A formula used when you want to find the distance between 2 locations.
     ### FOR: dist(a, b) = |b - a|
#### Find the distance between **-7* and *3*.  
Dist(-7, 3)      | apply formula
|3 - (-7)|       | configure the double minus'es
|3 + 7|          | switch signs 
10               | answer


- Distance in the xy-Plane
A formula used to calculate the straight-line distance between two points with coordinates (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂).
     ### FOR: dist(A, B) = √[(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²]
#### Find the distance between the points P(2, 5) and Q(-1, 1)
Dist = √[(-1 - 2)² + (1 - 5)²] | apply formula
√[(-3)² + (-4)²]               | solve inner-brackets
√[9 + 16]                      | solve exponents
√[25]                          | add rest of the numbers
5                              | solve square-root




## Equations of Circles

- Radius of a Circle
A formula used when you want to find the radius of a Circle where (H, K) is the center, (X, Y) is a point on the circle.
     ### FOR: r = √[(x - h)² + (y - k)²]
#### A circle has center(4, -2). a point on the circle is (1, 2). what is the radius?
r = √[(1 - 4)² + (2 -(- 2))²]  | apply formula
r = √[(-3)² + (4)²]            | solve in parenthesis
r = √[9 + 16]                  | solve exponents
r = √[25]                      | simplify addition
r = 5                          | solve square-root




- Standard form equation of a circle
     ### FOR: (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r²
#### A circle has center (3, -2) and radius 5. write its equation in standard form.
(x - 3)² + (y - (-2))² = 5²    | apply formula
(x - 3)² + (y + 2)² = 5²       | simplify parenthesis 
##### (This is the required form, meaning that the whole term 'standard form of a circle' means turning it into a form, not solving it.) 


## Slope of a Line Between Two Points

- Slope
The ratio of the change in y to the change in x; measure of the steepness of a line.


## Equations of Lines

- Point-Slope Form
A way to write the equation of a line
     ### FOR: y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)
#### A slope has m = -2 and passes through (3, 1). Write the equation in point-slope form.
y - 1 = -2(x - 3)  | apply formula
##### (This is the required form, meaning that the whole term 'point slope form' means turning it into a form, not solving it.) 


- Slope-Intercept Form
a way to represent linear relationships between two variables using slope and y-intercept.
     ### FOR: y = mx + b
#### Find the slope and y-intercept of the line given by  4x - 2y = 6.
4x - 2y = 6          | View equation
-2y = - 4x + 6       | isolate y-term
y = -4x/-2  +  6/-2  | divide both sides by -2 
y = 2x - 3           | answer




# Functions and Their Graphs




## What is a Function?

- Function
Any equation that can be written in "y=" form, without using "+-" sign.
     ### EX: f(x) = x^2



- Types of functions:                           Definiton:                                           Equations:
# Constant                |     Always outputs the same value regardless of input |    f(x) = c 
  Linear                  |     First-degree polynomial, constant rate of change  |    f(x) = mx + b
# Quadratic               |     Second-degree polynomial, inverted U-shaped       |    f(x) = ax² + bx + c (where a ≠ 0)
  Cubic                   |     Third-degree polynomial, S-shaped curve           |    f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d (where a ≠ 0)
# Polynomial              |     Sum of terms w/ non-negative integer exponents    |    f(x) = aₙxⁿ + aₙ₋₁xⁿ⁻¹ + ... + a₁x + a₀
  Radical                 |     A function that contains a root operation         |    f(x) = ⁿ√(g(x))



## Evaluate Functions




- Function notation
A way to write functions in this format 'f(x)' instead of 'y = '.
You can name these functions with alphabet characters, like 'A(x) = x^2' for the area of a rectangle and so on.
     ### EX: f(x) = x^2 



## Set Up and Simplify a Difference Quotient

- Difference Quotient
formula that finds the average rate of change of any function over an interval. 
There are two different types of functions for this formula. 1. linear.  2. quadratic 
     ### FOR: f(x + h) - f(x)
     ###      _______________
     ###             h
##### NOTE: This doesn't have an example equation because it is too long and complicated. watch videos or ask ai to help.


## Functions Defined by Graphs and Tables of Values




- The Vertical Line Test
Given a graph, if a vertical line can be drawn and intersects more than once with the graph, then the
graph does not define y as a function of x.

##### (NOTE: 'What is a vertical line?' A line that goes up and down.)

- vertical line test i.e:
     ### EX: points (3, 6) and (3, 2) would be connected vertically, since they are on the same x coordinate (x coordinate being 3 in the Example).


## Reading Graphs (Carefully)

- The shape of Graphs       *(NOT AN ACTUAL WORD OR TERM TO KNOW)*
You can use the shape of graphs to determine specific things, like when did a boat reach its highest speed, etc.


# Combinations of functions

## Evaluate Piecewise Functions

- Piecewise Function
a decision maker that tells you the output based on the input, output depending on the value of the 
input.
     ### FOR:         (Note that the piecewise function doesn't consist of specific formulas for 1, and only 1 situation, but in range for multiple.)
  ##### (output is OP, input is IP)
     ###          / 
     ###         { IP1    if OP1 
     ###  f(x) = { IP2    if OP2 
     ###         { IP3    if OP3
     ###          \



## Graph Piecewise Functions

- Domain
A set of all the possible inputs for a function (i.e: The **Piece-wise** Function.)


- Restricted Domain 
A specific part/portion of the domain inside a function.

Endpoints towards Restricted Domains          *(NOT AN ACTUAL WORD OR TERM TO KNOW)*
   ### When an endpoint is included,  represent it by using a closed circle.
   ### When an endpoint isn't included, represent it by using a open circle


## Composition of Piecewise Functions

- Composition of Functions
Written (f * g)(x) or f(g(x)), it is a function we use by substituting one function into another function during equations.
    ### FOR: (f * g)(x) or f(g(x))
#### solve  f(x) = 2x - 1       g(x) = x^2 + 3
#### Find:               f(g(2))       
g(2) = 2^2 + 3       | apply g(2). this makes 7, so we make it f(7)
f(g(2))  > f(7)      | f(g(2))  becomes f(7) because g(2) is 7 
f(7) = 2(7) - 1      | solve f(7), this makes 13.           **ANSWER: f(g(2)) = 13**




## Shifting And Stretching Graphs



Basic Translations to y = f (x) in Graphs:   *NOT AN ACTUAL WORD OR TERM TO KNOW)*

##### NOTE: USING ACTUAL NUMBERS FOR EXAMPLES, DIFFERENT NUMBERS MAY BE USED IN REAL-WORD EXAMPLES.

### [ - y = x^2 - 3      |    Shift down 3 units.     SUMMARY: minus = down 
###   - y = x^2 + 4      |    Shift up 4 units.       SUMMARY: plus = up 
###   - y = (x + 2)^2    |    Shift left 2 units.     SUMMARY: bracket-plus = left 
###   - y = (x - 1)^2    |    Shift right 1 units.    SUMMARY: bracket-minus = right

## The more      complex / difficult      translations:

###   - y = 2x^2         |    Vertical Stretch (like squeezing).
###   - y = 0.5x^2       |    Vertical Compression (like seperating).
###   - y = -x^2         |    Reflect across the axis (flip upsidedown)
###   - y = -3x^2        |    Stretch smaller and reflect across axis.
###   - y = -0.25x^2     |    Stretch bigger and reflect across axis.  ]



## Absolute Value Functions




- Absolute Value
The distance that a number is from 0 on a number line.
   ### EX: |3| = 3     |-6| = 6 


## Greatest Integer Functions


- The Greatest Integer Function
A mathematical rule and / or a function that describes the following; **'If a value isn't a integer, return the Greatest integer that is less than or equal to the input value.'**
### The Piece-wise function for this:
###        / 
###       { x.                           if x is an integer.
### ⌊x⌋ = { The closest integer < x.     if x is NOT an integer.
###       {
###        \






- Right triangle
A triangle that has one angle measuring exactly 90 angles.
inside the right angle:
    ### Hypotenuse: The side directly opposite to the right angle, always being the longest side.
    ### Opposite:   The length of the opposite side of the triangle, being the 90 angle.
    ### Adjacent:   The length of the 'Adjacent' side of the triangle, or the bottom.

                                                                              __________________________________________________ 
     ### Sine    : Tells you how big the side opposite the angle is                 |  opposite / hypotenuse     
     ###                                compared to the hypotenuse.                     
                                                                              __________________________________________________

- Coterminal
Different angle measurements that rotate around a circle but stop at the same direction.


- Unit circle
a diagram that shows every angle and its sine and cosine values by using points on a circle of radius 1.
##### NOTE: i cant show the diagram for the unit circle since it is complicated, but you can see it on the books exactly 100th page.


- Radian
The angle required to produce a circular arc whose length is equal to the radius. One radian is  180 degrees.


- Conversions Between Degrees and Radians

## Exponential And Logarithmic Functions


- Logarithim Function










# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ COMPLICATING THINGS PROBLEM SOLVING ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  This is clear information to know about formulas or questions. the reason i made this is because i
don't clearly pay attention to maximum detail - which is fine. people make mistakes. - and to help me learn.


## FORMS VS FORMULAS : 
- Forms and formulas have a *difference*.  its mostly written on the term to know like **'Slope-Intercept form'** or **'Point-Slope form'**.

Forms only need:
  add the things needed. (like add what number goes in x or y ) 
  solve to a basis where its possible.  after it cant be simplified (like if theres x + 4), stop. your done there!                  

Formulas need:
  subsitute things needed (just like forms!)
  simplify until you have one number left or you do as the main objective was in solving!



## SUBSITUTION CONFUSION :
- Whenever you substitue things into - even simple, like addition - formulas, you sometimes dont make sense of the letters! lets go through what these mean! :
###   x₂ - x₁     |     No matter any signs within the number needed to substitue, don't misplace them!  (this is the same with y, not just x!)
if your points are (-1, 3), (2, 4),  dont put the FIRST X (-1) where the second x should be (x₂)  even if its minus or plus! put it where it belongs! 







# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ TABLE OF FORMULAS TO KNOW: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
