# Tangent Lines, Velocites, and Growth



## Slope of a Tangent Line Visually

- Tangent Line
A line that touching (but not crossing) the graph of a function at a specific point.


## Average Rate of Change

- Average Rate of Change on the Interval [a, b]
Tells you how much a function’s output changes on average as the input goes from a to b.
You find it by subtracting the y-values and dividing by how far apart the x-values are .
### FOR: change in f      f(b) - f(a)
###      ———————————   =  ———————————
###      change in x         b - a
####



- Velocity
