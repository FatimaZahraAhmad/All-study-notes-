The Three USDA Food Patterns are as follows:
Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern: This is based on the types of foods Americans typically consume. The main types of food in this eating pattern include a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy, seafood, poultry, and meat, as well as eggs, nuts, seeds, and soy products.
Healthy Vegetarian Pattern: This pattern contains no meat, poultry, or seafood, but does contain fat-free or low-fat dairy and eggs. Compared with the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern, it contains more soy products, eggs, beans and peas, nuts and seeds, and whole grains.
Healthy Mediterranean-Style Pattern: This one contains more fruits and seafood and less dairy than the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern.

//3. Social and Cultural Factors Affecting Choosing //
// Foods //
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


basically says that people around us, choose something-- a food-- or something specific, if you grow with them, you'll like that specific thing as-well.

this is why families health is important, if your family sits together at the dinner table and values nutritious home cooked meals, you'll like home cooked meals, and you will grow up healthy--and some families go out for dining all the time, if you match with their not-so healthy personality, then you'll grow up like them.

some families or others. some religions forbid some meats (not just meat, but other foods as-well.), like beef or pork.

// 4. Your Health Status Affects Choosing Food ///
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////



our health status affects choosing foods, and its very important, if a person is diagnosed with a specific disease, such as hypertension--which means high blood pressure they may need a a salty diet, if they are diagnosed with diabetes, they may need a carbohydrate consistent diet. this overall means that our liking might change with diseases or changes happening.

women who are pregnant may develop smell or taste aversions, so she might not like the food she ate before, and liked, this is problematic if the woman isn't getting good nutrition and has a bad diet.

when we grow up, our taste buds change, and our preferences for sweetness and spiciness change, we don't like specific foods when we change.

if teeth are removed or if the gums hurt, when your chewing food it might hurt, and its painful, this leads to food aversions.

// 1. What is a Healthy Diet?///
/////////////////////////////////////////////////



what do you think of when you think about a healthy diet?

we think about healthful diets including nutrient dense foods from all major food groups, including lean proteins, whole grains, healthful fats, and fruits and veggies of many color.

nutrient dense foods are rich in minerals, vitamins, and other things important for life, without too much saturated fat, added sugars, and sodium.

healthy diets give a lot of benefits, like strong bones, good heart, and preventing diseases, and improving your well being.

/// 2. How Diets Affect Our Health ///
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////






Most Americans don't have a healthy diet, and that begins at birth--breastfeeding is the source of nutrition for infants.

Only 1 in 4 is exclusively breastfed through 6 months of age as recommended, fewer than 1 in 10 adults eat enough fruits and veggies, 9 in 10 Americans aged consume more than recommended amount of sodium.

6 in 10 people aged 2 to 19 yrs and 5 in 10 adults consume a sugary drink on any day, unhealthy foods, and other things, increase the risk of chronic diseases.

Doing good things like enough physical activity, sleep, and healthy diets, help children grow healthy and prevent obesity, and overweightness, and chronic diseases.

In us 19% of young people from 2 to 19 years and 40% of adults have obesity, which put them at risk for heart, diabetes, and cancer diseases.

obesity and overweight costs the us healthcare system $147 Billion a year.

// 2a. Heart Health //
/////////////////////////////////


According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart disease is the leading cause of death for adults in the US.

The American Heart Association (AHA) said that almost half of US adults live with some form of cardiovascular disease.

Two of the leading causes of heart disease and stroke are high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol. 

Consuming too much sodium can increase blood pressure and the risk for heart disease and stroke. 
guidelines recommend getting less than 2,300 mg a day, but Americans consume more than 3,400 mg a day on average.

The dietary approaches to stop hypertension diet, known as the DASH diet, is a great place to start learning how to eat a more heart healthy diet.

The DASH diet is defined as: low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol; rich in potassium, magnesium, calcium, and fiber;

emphasizing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products; including fish, poultry, nuts, and seeds; 

and limiting red meat, sweets, and sugary beverages.

/// 2B. Decreased Risk of Cancer ////
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


An unhealthy diet can increase the risk of some cancers. Overweight and obesity are associated with at least 13 types of cancer, including endometrial (uterine) cancer, breast cancer in postmenopausal women, and colorectal cancer.

These cancers make up 40% of all cancers diagnosed.
Eating foods that contain antioxidants can lower your risk of developing cancer by protecting cells from damage.

Free radicals in our body increases the risk of cancer, but antioxidants remove those free radicals and can lower our risk.

Free radicals
an oxygen molecule that has lost an electron and will stabilize itself by stealing an electron from a nearby molecule

Foods that contain these antioxidants include fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes because they have beta-carotene, lycopene, and vitamins A, C, and E.

// 2C. Weight Maintenance //
///////////////////////////////////////////////




Foods including fruits, vegetables, and beans are lower in calories than most processed foods. 

Choosing these foods over fast food or processed food will help you stay within your daily calorie, fat, and sodium limits.

Maintaining a healthy weight is important because a healthy weight reduces your risk of chronic disease.

It’s not just our physical health that can improve when we prioritize a healthy diet.


Foods that are high in omega 3 fatty acids, vitamin b12, folate, and vitamin D have been linked to lower levels of depression and anxiety.

Diets higher in fruits and vegetables have been linked to improved brain function and memory.

Eating healthy is also a way to improve your body image. A positive body image can lead to better self-esteem.

// 3. Ways to Support Healthy Eating //
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////




About 60 million US children spend time in early care and education facilities or schools.

These settings can directly influence what children eat and drink and how active they are, and build a foundation for healthy habits.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Healthy Schools program works with states, school systems, communities, and national partners to promote good nutrition.

These efforts include publishing guidelines and tips on how schools and parents can model healthy behaviors and offer healthier school meals, smart snacks, and water access.

// 1. What Makes a Healthy Diet? //
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////



Eating a healthy, balanced diet is one of the most important things you can do to protect your health.


But what makes a healthy diet? In this tutorial, we will review the foundational concepts to a healthy diet. Healthy eating
doesn’t involve any particular diet.

Rather, it means prioritizing your health by fueling your body with a variety of
nutrient-rich foods.



page 23
/////////////////////////////////
// 1a. Nutrients //
/////////////////////////////////




There are six classes of nutrients that we will cover in depth later on. These are carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins, minerals, and water. Each nutrient has many physiological roles in the body.


Nutrients are made of elements (a substance like oxygen or carbon that cannot be separated into more simple substances) and elements make up living things.

All nutrients are important for our health, but some are essential. Essential nutrients must be supplied by our diet because our bodies cannot make them. Water, for example, is the most essential nutrient because humans can only survive a few days without water. An example of a non-essential 

nutrient would be vitamin D since you can eat it, but your body can also make this vitamin.





page 24
/////////////////////////////////
//1b. Calories //
/////////////////////////////////


The energy released from our macronutrients can be measured in calories.

Calories are small units of energy. The units are so small that in order to make things more simple when we talk about nutrition.

we use 1,000- calorie metric units known as kilocalories (shortened to kcalories, but commonly called “calories”).

When you read that a snack provides “150 calories,” it actually means 150 kcalories.

Most foods are mixtures of nutrients, and water is generally the major nutrient in all foods.

An example is 8 ounces of fluid skim milk, which contains about 91% water by weight. 

Milk is also a great source of protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. In this example, 
we would say that the milk is nutrient-dense.

Nutrient dense means that the food we choose supplies more key beneficial ingredients (like fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals) in relation to its calories per serving.

In contrast, a candy bar may have about 40% water by weight, and though it contains protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals, these are in much smaller quantities.

The candy bar would be energy-dense. Energy-dense means that the amount of calories per serving is high in relation to the amount of nutrients it provides.

Some people refer to this as “empty calories”. This tells us that some foods are more healthy to consume than others. We sometimes have to be careful though.




24 to 25
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// 2. Creating Balance When Choosing Your Diet //
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


To begin, we need to understand moderation, balance, and adequacy.

Obtaining nutrients from a wide variety of food is important to our health so that we can ensure we are getting the right amounts of nutrients.

To help ensure the adequacy of our diet, we should eat from all food groups. We should also consume foods in moderation.

Moderation means we eat foods in reasonable amounts and helps us to get enough nutrients from our food without having to eat excessive amounts of one food.

An example of moderation is that you use portion control and eat reasonable amounts of lots of dierent foods. In the following image, you can see how a healthy plate is portioned:



fruits and vegetables should cover 1/2 of the plate.

healthy oils should be at the middle.

proteins should cover 1/4 of the plate.

grains should cover 1/4 of the plate.

// 1. The Science of Nutrition//
///////////////////////////////////////////////////


Nutrition is the science that links food to health and includes how humans ingest, digest, absorb, transport, use, and excrete food. In an earlier lesson, we discussed how personal experiences and social media may be sources of information for people as they learn more about nutrition. 

We learned how health fraud and misinformation can be detrimental to our health. Similarly, in the past, nutrition concepts have been founded in intuition, anecdotes, or tradition.

Just as it is dangerous to use social media as a source for nutrition facts, anecdotes and traditions can be dangerous. Nutrition is a science that integrates biology, chemistry,
mathematics, and more. 

Nutrition researchers use the scientific method to guide their work and help us make better choices for our health.

Scientific Method A process used to assess observations and answer questions.
