## Introduction to Nutrition

### Nutrition-Related Health Statistics

In the United States alone, millions of people die every year due to nutrition-related causes like overweight and obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.

### Nutrition Information Quality

**Fad Diet** - A diet that promotes quick weight loss without taking into effect the nutrients your body needs.

**Health Claim** - Claims that have been reviewed by the FDA and are allowed on food products showing that a food or food component may reduce the risk of a disease or a health-related condition.

**Health Fraud** - Fraud involving the selling of drugs, devices, foods, or cosmetics that have not been proven effective.

**Nutrition Misinformation** - Information that is not supported by science and may be misleading or incomplete.

## Nutrition Professionals

### Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN)

**RDN** - A nutrition expert required to complete a specialized degree in dietetics, nutrition, public health, or other related sciences.

#### Requirements to become an RDN:
1. Complete a minimum of a bachelor's degree
2. Complete a supervised practice program that is accredited (typically 6-12 month programs)
3. Pass a national exam given by the Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR)
4. Continue to complete continuing education requirements each year

## Basic Nutrition Concepts

### Food Characteristics

**Palatability** - Acceptable to the taste; sufficiently agreeable in flavor to be eaten.

**Seasonality** - Produce that is purchased and consumed around the time that it is harvested.

**Nutrient-Dense Food** - Foods that are rich in vitamins, minerals and other nutrients important for health, without too much saturated fat, added sugars and sodium.

**Food Aversions** - A strong dislike of a specific food or foods, basically picky eaters.

### Health Conditions

**Health Status** - Refers to your medical conditions (both physical and mental health), claims experience, receipt of health care, medical history, genetic information, evidence of insurability, and disability.

**Hypertension** - Another name for high blood pressure. It can lead to severe health complications and increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and sometimes death. Blood pressure is the force that a person's blood exerts against the walls of their blood vessels.

**Diabetes** - A chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy, this is because of too much sugar in your blood.

**Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)** - A general term for conditions affecting the heart or blood vessels. It's usually associated with a build-up of fatty deposits inside the arteries (atherosclerosis) and an increased risk of blood clots.

## Dietary Patterns and Guidelines

### DASH Diet

**DASH Diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)** - A flexible and balanced eating plan that helps create a heart-healthy eating style for life. It is:
- Low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol
- Rich in potassium, magnesium, calcium, and fiber
- Emphasizing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products
- Including fish, poultry, nuts, and seeds
- Limiting red meat, sweets, and sugary beverages

### Antioxidants

**Antioxidants** - Substances that can prevent or slow damage to cells caused by free radicals, unstable molecules that the body produces as a reaction to environmental and other pressures.

**Free Radicals** - An oxygen molecule that has lost an electron and will stabilize itself by stealing an electron from a nearby molecule.

Foods containing antioxidants include fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes because they have beta-carotene, lycopene, and vitamins A, C, and E.

## Government Agencies and Research

### Regulatory Bodies

**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** - The CDC is a U.S. agency that tracks and fights diseases, gives health advice, and helps keep people safe—like with diabetes or CVD.

**Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** - The FDA regulates food, drugs, and more to make sure they're safe and labeled right.

**United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)** - A department responsible for developing and executing laws related to farming, forestry, rural economic development, and food.

### Dietary Guidelines

**Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)** - A set of guidelines that are updated every five years to guide policymakers, nutrition experts (like Registered Dietitian Nutritionists), and other health professionals to promote health and prevent disease.

**Dietary Pattern** - The combination of foods and beverages that constitutes an individual's complete dietary intake over time. This may be a description of a customary way of eating or a description of a combination of foods recommended for consumption.

### Research Methods

**Peer-Reviewed Journals** - Articles that have gone through an evaluation process in which journal editors and other expert scholars critically assess the quality and scientific merit of the article and its research.

**Control Group** - The standard to which comparisons are made in an experiment.

**Experimental Group** - A group that receives a treatment in an experiment, sometimes called a treatment group.

**Variable** - A factor or condition in a research study that can exist in differing amounts or types.

### Major Studies

**Epidemiology** - The study of the occurrence, distribution, and factors that contribute to health problems in populations.

**National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)** - A program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States.

**Framingham Heart Study** - A long-term, ongoing cardiovascular cohort study of residents of the city of Framingham, Massachusetts. Much of the knowledge concerning heart disease, such as the effects of diet, exercise, and common medications such as aspirin, is based on this longitudinal study.

**Scurvy** - A disease caused by a deficiency of vitamin C, characterized by swollen bleeding gums and the opening of previously healed wounds, which particularly affected poorly nourished sailors until the end of the 18th century.

## Healthy Diet Principles

### Evidence-Based Practice

**Evidence-Based** - A practice that has been rigorously evaluated in experimental evaluations—like randomized controlled trials—and shown to make a positive, statistically significant difference in important outcomes.

### Core Principles

**Adequacy** - The sufficient intake of essential nutrients, needed to fulfill nutritional requirements for optimal health.

**Balance** - Consuming foods from multiple food groups to maintain optimal nutrition status.

**Moderation** - Avoidance of excess or extremes.

### Food Groups

**Food Group Plan** - A plan to help you build a diet from clusters of foods that are similar in nutrient content.

**The Five Food Groups** - Fruits, Vegetables, Grains, Protein Foods, and Dairy.

### USDA Food Patterns

**The Three USDA Food Patterns**:

1. **Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern** - Based on the types of foods Americans typically consume. Main types include a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy, seafood, poultry, and meat, as well as eggs, nuts, seeds, and soy products.

2. **Healthy Vegetarian Pattern** - Contains no meat, poultry, or seafood, but does contain fat-free or low-fat dairy and eggs. Compared with the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern, it contains more soy products, eggs, beans and peas, nuts and seeds, and whole grains.

3. **Healthy Mediterranean-Style Pattern** - Contains more fruits and seafood and less dairy than the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern.

### MyPlate System

**MyPlate** - Used to teach children and adults what amount of food is right for them.

**Size It Right** - A guide (based on standards that most nutritionists follow) to what one serving should look like.

**Portion Guidelines**:
- Fruits and vegetables should cover 1/2 of the plate
- Healthy oils should be at the middle
- Proteins should cover 1/4 of the plate
- Grains should cover 1/4 of the plate

## Factors Affecting Food Choices

### Social and Cultural Factors

Social and cultural factors significantly influence food choices. People around us choose specific foods, and if you grow with them, you'll like those specific foods as well.

- **Family influence**: If your family sits together at the dinner table and values nutritious home-cooked meals, you'll like home-cooked meals and grow up healthy
- **Dining patterns**: Some families go out for dining all the time, which may lead to less healthy eating habits
- **Religious restrictions**: Some religions forbid certain foods (not just meat, but other foods as well), like beef or pork

### Health Status Impact

Our health status affects choosing foods and is very important:
- **Disease-specific diets**: If a person is diagnosed with a specific disease, such as hypertension (high blood pressure), they may need a low-salty diet. If diagnosed with diabetes, they may need a carbohydrate-consistent diet
- **Pregnancy changes**: Women who are pregnant may develop smell or taste aversions, so they might not like the food they ate before and liked
- **Age-related changes**: When we grow up, our taste buds change, and our preferences for sweetness and spiciness change
- **Physical factors**: If teeth are removed or if gums hurt, chewing food might be painful, leading to food aversions

## Nutrition Science

### Scientific Method in Nutrition

**Scientific Method** - A process used to assess observations and answer questions.

#### Steps of the Scientific Method:
1. **Identify the problem (question)**
2. **Gather data (research)**
3. **Formulate hypothesis**
4. **Test hypothesis**
5. **Does the new data agree?** (If yes, make hypothesis again and test it again)

## Nutrients and Energy

### Essential Nutrients

**Essential Nutrient** - Vitamins, minerals, protein, fats, water, and carbohydrates.

**Macronutrient** - Carbohydrates, fat, and protein. They are the nutrients you use in the largest amounts.

**Micronutrient** - Vitamins and minerals that are vital to healthy development, disease prevention, and well-being.

### Energy Concepts

**Calorie** - A unit of energy that people get from the food and drink they consume.

**Nutrient-Dense** - Foods that supply more key beneficial ingredients (like fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals) in relation to their calories per serving.

**Energy-Dense** - The amount of calories per serving is high in relation to the amount of nutrients it provides. Some people refer to this as "empty calories."

**Kilocalories** - Small units of energy. The units are so small that in nutrition we use 1,000-calorie metric units known as kilocalories (shortened to kcalories, but commonly called "calories"). When you read that a snack provides "150 calories," it actually means 150 kcalories.
