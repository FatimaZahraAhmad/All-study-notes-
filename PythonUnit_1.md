​Input Ways a program gets its data; user input through the keyboard, mouse, or other device.
Processing Takes the data inputs and prompts and calculates the results (output).

Output The results at the end of a program based on user input and system processing.


Syntax The syntax is the “grammar” rules of the programming language. Each programming language (like Python) has its own syntax.
Compiler A compiler scans an entire program and attempts to convert the whole program at once to machine code.
Machine Code Also known as machine language. The computer uses binary (0s and 1s) to perform tasks. At a high level, the programming language code that you write gets translated or compiled to the machine code that the computer understands.

Bytecode An intermediary step for code conversion between the programming language that you write and the machine code that a computer uses.
Interpreter An interpreter takes the bytecode one line at a time and converts it to machine code.
Virtual Machine A software program that behaves like a completely separate computer within an application.

Algorithm A logical step-by-step plan that we need to build for solving a problem

Pseudo-code English-like statements that describe the steps in a program or algorithm.
String A data type that can store a literal string as a value.
Literal String A series of characters that are combined together and enclosed in quotes; for example, "Enter in the second number" is a literal string.



Variable A named memory location that has the ability to hold various distinct values at different points in time in the program.

Comments The “#” (hashtag) is used in Python code to identify a comment. Commented lines of code are ignored by the compiler during run time. A programmer adds comments throughout the code to explain how the program or function works.
Module A self-contained piece of code that can be used in different programs.

Integrated Development Environment (IDE) A text editor that has additional functionality to allow developers to perform some additional tasks to simplify the workflow of the development process.
Libraries/Library Pre-written code collections that you can use when developing a program.

print() The print() function allows Python to send data to the output screen.
Syntax Error A syntax error means that you have violated the “grammar” rules of Python.

Edge Case Values that are at the end of a testing range.
Interior Test Test values that are within a specific range where the precise values that we entered within that range did not matter.
Corner Case The value you are testing is in between two edge cases.


Value One of the basic units of data, like a number or string, that a program manipulates.
= The = operator (equal sign) is an assignment operator that is used to assign values to variables.

Statement A unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute.
Expression A combination of values, variables, and operators.
Camel Case Combining words where each word except the first word will start with a capital letter.
Pascal Case Combining words where each word starts with a capital letter.
Snake Case Combining words where each word is separated by an underscore and all of the words are in lowercase

Str A text data type consisting of characters that are enclosed in either single or double quotes.
Int A numeric data type consisting of an integer or a whole number. It can either be a positive or a negative number but it does not have any decimals.
Float A numeric data type referring to a floating point number. It is a number that can be positive or negative and uses decimal values.
Complex A numeric data type consisting of a number that is the sum of a real number and an imaginary number.
Bool A boolean data type consisting of a value of either True or False.
Base 10 Numbers Also called decimal values, these are numbers using 10 digits that go from 0 to 9.
Base 2 Numbers Also called binary numbers, these are numbers using two digits, 0 or 1.
Base 8 Numbers Also called octal numbers, these are numbers using 8 digits, going from 0 to 7.
Base 16 Numbers Also called hexadecimal numbers, these are any numbers using 10 digits (0 to 9) and 6 letters (A, B, C, D, E, and F).

type() The type() function takes a value or variable as input and returns the type of the value or variable.

Empty String An empty string is a string that is identified but does not contain anything; it is essentially empty.


Escape Character Special characters that when added to a string will allow quotes of a string to be escaped
`
examples:

/ = Placing the \ at the end of a line, the backslash and newline are ignored.

\\ = outputs the backslash
\' = outputs the single quote
\" = outputs the double quote
/b = the \b stands for backspace and removes the character prior to the /b
/n = the \n adds a new line after each \n
\t = the 't adds a tab

Concatenation The operation of joining or merging two or more strings together.

+
The + operator adds integers or concatenates strings (joins them end to end). Mixing strings and integers with + causes an error.

*
The * operator multiplies integers or replicates strings (repeats them) based on an integer multiplier. It doesn’t work with floats for replication.

in
The in operator checks if a value is in a sequence (returns True or False) and can also loop through sequences in a for loop.


capitalize() The .capitalize() method will convert the first character of the string to an uppercase with all of the other characters to a
lowercase.
.index() The .index() method can find the location of a character or a string within another string
.lower() The .lower() method will convert all of the characters of a string to lowercase including the first character.
.swapcase() The .swapcase() method returns a copy of the string with the uppercase characters converted to lowercase and the lowercase characters converted to uppercase.
.title() The .title() method returns a copy of the string where the first letter of each word is converted to uppercase with the other characters converted to lowercase.
.upper() The .upper() method is the opposite of the .lower() method and converts all of the characters of a string to uppercase.
Argument An argument is an actual value(s) that is being passed into the function when it is being called.
Casting (or Type-Casting) Casting is when you convert a variable’s value from one data type to another.
Functions A function is a section of code that runs when it is called. We have the ability to pass in data into those functions, which are called parameters.

Conditional Statement A conditional statement is a statement that controls the ow of execution depending on some condition.
Condition A condition is a boolean expression in a conditional statement that determines which branch is executed


Compound Statement A statement that consists of a header line that ends with the colon character (:) followed by an indented block. It is called compound since it stretches across more than one line.
pass A pass statement is a reserved keyword that is essentially a statement that will do nothing.

and The and operator is a reserved keyword and boolean operator that takes two arguments and returns a boolean value of False unless both inputs are True.
Short-Circuit Evaluation Short-circuit evaluation is when the evaluation of a logical expression stops because the overall value is already known.
or The or operator is a reserved keyword and boolean operator that outputs True if either input is True (or both).


Truth Table A truth table is a small table that lists every possible input value and gives results for the operators.


Boolean Operators Boolean operators (also known as logical operators) allow us to build and combine more complex boolean expressions from more basic expressions.

Traceback A traceback is a list of functions that are executed and printed to the screen when an exception occurs. Exceptions Errors detected during execution (running of the code) are called exceptions.
try and except try and except are reserved keywords. The idea of the try and except statements is that you know that some sequence of instruction(s) may have a problem and you want to add some statements to be executed if an error occurs. These extra statements (the except block) are ignored if there is no error.
as The as keyword is one of Python’s reserved keywords and simply is used to create an alias

binary 2 numbers, are 2 digits
