## Polynomial Basics

### Definitions

**Monomial** - An expression containing a single term. The prefix "mono" means "one". (Examples: Monopoly = market controlled by single company, Monocle = eye-wear with single lens)

**Polynomial** - An expression with several terms. The prefix "poly" means "many." (Example: Polytheistic religion believes in many deities)

**Degree (of a Term)** - The sum of all variable exponent powers in the term or polynomial.

**Degree (of a Polynomial)** - Also called order, the highest degree of the terms in a polynomial expression.

**Like Terms** - Same variables which are raised to the same power. Examples: 2x² and 7x² are like terms. To combine them, add their coefficients. If coefficients are negative, treat as subtraction.

## Polynomial Operations

### Ordering Polynomials

**Proper Order**: Write terms in order of descending degree (highest to lowest).

### Adding Polynomials

**Vertical Addition Method**:
1. Write polynomials vertically, aligning like terms
2. Use terms with coefficient of zero as placeholders for missing terms
3. Combine coefficients of like terms

### Subtracting Polynomials

**Vertical Subtraction Method**:
1. Write polynomials vertically with alignment
2. Add zero coefficients for missing terms
3. Group each polynomial in parentheses
4. Subtract coefficients of like terms, being careful with signs

## Multiplication of Polynomials

### Distributive Property

**Single Term Distribution**: Distribute the single term into each term in parentheses, then evaluate the multiplication.

**Multiple Term Distribution**: Use FOIL method for binomial multiplication:
- **F** - First terms
- **O** - Outside terms
- **I** - Inside terms
- **L** - Last terms

**Multiplication Rules**:
- Multiply coefficients together
- Add exponents for same variables
- Write different variables next to each other to show multiplication
- Rewrite in descending order of degree

## Factoring Polynomials

### Common Factor Method

**Steps**:
1. Identify common factor in all terms
2. Rewrite each term with the common factor
3. Factor out the common factor
4. Rewrite parentheses if needed (negative signs become subtraction)

### Division of Polynomials

**Polynomial Long Division**: Similar to numeric long division with these steps:
1. Divide
2. Multiply
3. Subtract
4. Bring down next term
5. Repeat until complete

**Synthetic Division**: A process designed to be easier than polynomial long division.

**Synthetic Division Steps**:
1. Set up using coefficients of dividend polynomial and constant term of divisor
2. Bring first number down below
3. Multiply this number by value to left of box
4. Write product below next number in box
5. Add vertically, write below box
6. Repeat until no more operations

**Important Note**: For divisor (x - a), if factor has plus sign, the value of "a" is actually negative.

## Special Polynomial Types

### Quadratic

**Quadratic** - A second-degree polynomial, with an x-squared term as its highest degree term.

## Applications

### Electrical Applications

**Voltage Calculation**: To find voltage, multiply current by resistance.

**Current Calculation**: To get expression for current, divide voltage by resistance (voltage as numerator, resistance as denominator).
