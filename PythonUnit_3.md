# Python Programming Unit 3

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Core Concepts

**Object-Oriented Programming** - A programming model that organizes the design of code by bundling objects.

**Class Instantiation** - The process of creating an instance of a class which is called an object.

### Classes and Objects

**Class** - The class keyword defines the data and code that will make up each of the objects. When defining a class, it starts with the class keyword and is then followed by the name of the class and a colon.

**Attributes** - Data defined in the class template and are the characteristics or properties of an object.

**. (dot) operator** - Connects the object (instance of a class) to the attributes and methods of that object.

### Object Methods

**__init__** - The __init__ method's sole purpose is to initialize (assign values) to the object's attributes and it is only used within a class.

### Object Management

**del** - The del keyword is used to delete objects, and since everything in Python is an object, we can use this keyword to delete anything, including variables, lists, etc.

## Inheritance

### Inheritance Concepts

**Inheritance** - A relationship model that allows us to define a class that inherits all the attributes and methods from another class.

**Base Class** - Also known as the parent class. It is the class that is being inherited from.

**Subclass** - Also known as the child class. It is the class that inherits from another class. A subclass is known to "extend" the base class, meaning that it can define additional data that will not affect the base class.

### Inheritance Functions

**super()** - The super() function allows a subclass to access the base class attributes and methods.
