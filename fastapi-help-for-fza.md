Hello. This folder / text file i made is to have all the fastapi commands or thins that are important to remember.

`. **NOTE: ALL OF THESE COMMANDS *MAY* HAVE ALREADY MADE NAMES INSIDE, LIKE 'venv'.**



# . To *make* a virtual enviorment, use this command: 

`python3 -m venv venv`


## . `cd fastapi`

# . To turn on the virtual enviorment, use this command:

`source venv/bin/activate`


# . To turn on the app [Meaning make it save the contents of what you just wrote] use this command:

`uvicorn main:app`

## . though, it might be irritating since, in order to apply changes every time you save your code, you have to use that.
##           you can use this to keep reloading it everytime:

`uvicorn main:app -- reload`


# . To install fastapi and all the things you may need to use fastapi, use this command [If you havent already.] :

`pip install fastapi`

## . There is another command to install EVERYTHING in fastapi, so nothing gets left out. :

`pip install fastapi[all]`


## . What is CRUD?

Crud is an acronym that represents the four main functions of an application. regardless of what application your making, it needs to have these.

C - Create

R - Read

U - Update

D - Delete


# . 




# . What is an id?  it is a unique identifier to give unique numbers or mark some values in a specific order, also called a path parameter.



# . What is a Database?

A collection of organized data that can be easily accessed and managed.


# . DBMS

We don’t work or interact with databases directly, 
Instead we make use of a software referred to as a Database Management System (DBMS).


# . Popular DBMS

## . Relational

 - MySQL
 - PostgreSQL
 - Oracle
 - SQL Server

## . NoSQL

 - MongoDB
 - DynamoDB
 - Oracle
 - SQL Server


# . Relational Database & SQL

* Structured Query Language (SQL) – Language used to communicate with a DBMS


# . Postgres

* Each instance of postgres can be carved into multiple separate databases


# . Postgres

* By default every Postgres installation comes with one database already created called "postgres"
* This is important because Postgres requires you to specify the name of a database to make a connection. So there needs to always be one database
