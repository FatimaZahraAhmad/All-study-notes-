HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) A communication protocol designed for the World Wide Web for transferring data files and assets between computer systems.

TCP/IP 
TCP/IP is the internet's communication backbone, where TCP ensures reliable data delivery and IP handles addressing and routing.

World Wide Web (WWW) A collection of information and resources that are accessible over the Internet. Also called Web, WWW, and W3.

Computer Network Two or more computer systems connected together via communication media that use communication protocols to transmit data between each other.

Communication Protocol A set of rules used to define the communication method and process between electronic devices.

Client A computer system or device that sends a request to a server over a network.

Server A computer system or device that listens for and attempts to respond to and fulfill requests.

OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection):
1. Physical : converts data into physical signal 

2. Data Link : associates the physical media access control (MAC) with the virtual ip address of the system

3. Network : determines the physical path the data will take across multiple networks

4. Transport : determines how data will be transmitted using tcp or udp

5. Session : maintains communication sessions between different systems

6. Presentation : data is encoded to a usable format and may be encrypted for privacy

7. Application : users interact with applications that use network services to access resources

UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Connectionless, fast, no guarantees (e.g., video streaming, VoIP).
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Connection-oriented, reliable, ordered (e.g., web browsing, file transfers).

Key Difference: UDP sacrifices reliability for speed, while TCP ensures data arrives intact, even if slower.


Physical (Layer 1) – Raw bits (cables, Wi-Fi signals).
Data Link (Layer 2) – Frames (MAC addresses, switches).
Network (Layer 3) – Packets & IP addresses (routers).
Transport (Layer 4) – Reliable data delivery (TCP/UDP).
Session (Layer 5) – Manages connections (start/end sessions).
Presentation (Layer 6) – Data translation (encryption, compression).
Application (Layer 7) – End-user apps (HTTP, FTP, SMTP).

Network Packet Formatted data units that contain control information and a payload of data and are transmitted across a network.
OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) A fundamental concept that standardizes network protocols and technology. The OSI Model contains seven layers with specific responsibilities. Also called OSI Stack 

the internet protocol (IP) is a network protocol for computer networks, its responsibility is addressing network packets to the correct location.

the internet protocols primary role is two fold:

1. provide unique identifiers for networks and hosts.

2. provide routing capabillitites (the ability to communicate across multiple interconnected networks)

Internet Protocol (IP) Part of the TCP/IP protocol suite, Internet Protocol is responsible for addressing computer devices for the purpose of identifying devices connected to a network and locating devices that are connected to remotenetworks.
Network Router Device connected to multiple networks that forwards packets onto other networks based on its configured routing rules.

Connection-Oriented Protocol A type of protocol that establishes a connection between two endpoints (sender and receiver) before transmitting data across a consistent pathway.
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Similar communication method to HTTP but differs in how it communicates by avoiding error checking and correction in favor of improved transmission.

udp is a transport protocol.
Connectionless Protocol A type of protocol that provides a best-effort delivery of data packets without guaranteeing reliability or ordering.

FTP (file transfer protocol)
FTP is a network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server over the internet, providing reliable and efficient means of file transfer, it relies on tcp and is often used by web developers to uploud files to a web server easily.

DNS (Domain name service)
DNS Is a protocol and distributed server that translates domain names into the ip adress of the associated server, this service helps necause its easier for us to remember a name then a string of numbers.

Name Servers Host DNS records for individual domains and each record contains entries that tie specific domain names and subdomains to IP addresses.

DNS Records Each record pertains to one domain name and contains entries that tie the domain and subdomains to IP addresses and other domains.

When a DNS record is created or updated, other DNS servers have to be made aware of the change. This process can take anywhere from 24 hours (usually less) up to a week to make it through the Internet. As a result, you may receive inconsistent feedback regarding whether a site has gone live or not just after updating a DNS. 

A Record A DNS entry that associates a domain name or subdomain to an IPv4 address.

AAAA Record
A DNS entry that associates a domain name or subdomain to an IPv6 address.

CNAME A DNS entry that creates a subdomain and associates it to another domain or subdomain


DNAME A DNS entry that maps a subdomain to another external domain.

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) A protocol for sending and receiving emails.

Server-Side Scripting Programming languages that reside on and are executed by the server prior to being communicated to the client.

HTTP Request A message sent to a server that contains a specified method, a Universal Resource Identifier, headers, and possibly a body of data to request the server perform some type of operation.

HTTP response
A message sent in response to an HTTP Request that contains a status code, brief status message, and the requested content

HTTP method
On the front end, HTTP request methods are used to specify what kind of operation the client wants the server to perform. These methods include the following:
1. GET is used to retrieve resources from the server. 2. POST is used to transmit data to the server, usually to create a new resource. 3. PUT is used to transmit data to the server to update an existing resource. 4. DELETE is used to remove a resource from a server.
5. PATCH is used to partially modify a resource on the server.

HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure Protocol (HTTPS) A variation of the HTTP protocol that employs encryption to protect the privacy of any information transmitted between the client and server. Also called HTTP/S or HTTP(S).

Web-based Integrated Development Environments are full IDEs that include online storage and are accessible through a basic web browser

The benefits of using web-based IDEs are numerous and include:
1. Your development process is completely uncoupled from the physical computer you are using. 
2. Collaboration and code sharing is inherent with online web-based platforms. 
3. Code can be compiled and code files and resources can be packaged for deployment. 
4. Most have integrated support for Git version control system and forking of projects. 
5. Some provide the ability to use package managers to install additional software and code packages.

Git is a version control system (VCS)—a tool that helps developers track changes to their code over time. Think of it like a "time machine" for your files

Branching
